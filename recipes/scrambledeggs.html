    <h3>Steps to turn the cackle berry into an easier edible product</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on/start source of heat</li>
            <li>Put pan on heatsource</li>
            <li>Let pan warm up enough that it's warm to touch, but not too hot to touch. Try 'n fuckin keep it there at that sexy temp</li>
            <li>Add your choice of food lube</li>
            <li>Let food lube get warm</li>
            <li>Crack eggs, put the gooey parts in the pan, toss the shells</li>
            <li>Break yolks if they aren't already broke</li>
            <li>Stir until yolks are adequately distro'd throughout -- this is based on your preference, you fuckin' booger</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some salt over what is in pan</li>
            <li>Watch the eggs</li>
            <li>When you notice eggs getting white-ish on the bottom, giv'm a quick stir</li>
            <li>Repeat previous step until all clear stuff is no longer see-through. You know what I mean?</li>
            <li>Gently flip pan's contents with spatula every, oh, i dunno, 30sex or so</li>
            <li>Continue until eggs are slightly softer than the desired firmness of bird by-product</li>
            <li>Take off heat, give a quick flip/stir</li>
            <li>Leave in pan for, oh, Idk, 'bout 2min, sprinkle with peppah if you like</li>
            <li>Eat directly from pan, or move to a bowl or plate if you a bourgeois bitch to eat from there... Bogus points if you eat with a utensil</li>
        </ol>
            <h3>Unnecessary, maybe helpful tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>if you hear a seering, or there's a large amount of steam, remove from heat, stir until that sizzling stops. If eggs stop cooking in pan, put back on heat</li>
            <li>THE TRICK IS TO CONTROL THE HEAT DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE EGGS AS THEY COOK</li>
            <li>Take them off the heat before they're proper "done" b/c the residual heat will cook through the rest. Let them cook 'til "done" on heat source will only make the eggs a little more cooked than you want, and if you want'm sorta rubbery already, well a) you're a fucking idiot with no palette, and b) it'll make'm too rubbery</li>
        </ul>
